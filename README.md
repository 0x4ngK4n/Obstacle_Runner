# A Game written in Python (using Pygame module). All thanks to a YouTube tutorial from 'Clear Code' channel.

## By making this game, I wished to brush up my Python fundamentals while creating something FUN!
## And hey! this is also my first game dev project (who knows if I wanna do more if it :smile:)

### How to run it? 
### **# python3 obstacle_runner.py**
